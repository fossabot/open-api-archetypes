    ## `Locale`

    The `Locale` archetype represents a general notion of place, location, or
    context.


    `Locales` can represent contexts that don't correspond to real places or
    locations. For example, you could extend `Locale` with a
    `LoyaltyProgramCode` that represents an airline's or supermarket's loyalty
    card program.

    ## `IsoCountryCode`

    `IsoCountryCode` extends `Locale` to provide a country defined in [ISO
    3166](https://www.iso.org/iso-3166-country-codes.html).

            challenge applicable to the requested resource. The client MAY
            repeat the request with a suitable Authorization header field
